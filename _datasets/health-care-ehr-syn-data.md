title: Health Care-EHR-Syn Data
organization: KnowDive
notes: >-
  There is an increasing interest across European Union (EU) institutions,
  government and healthcare systems to digitalise the healthcare ecosystem. As
  it was proven by the COVID-19 pandemic, a digital healthcare ecosystem would
  facilitate across-borders processes, creating homogeneity across Europe. There
  is not a single common European Electronic Health Record (EHR) system for all
  EU member states. The objective of this project is to develop an easy-to-use
  knowledge graph that, integrated with EHR data, will result in a tool that
  facilitates healthcare data visibility and transfer. The aim of the project is
  to build a knowledge graph (KG) concerning healthcare heterogeneous data about
  patients, professionals, facilities and other entities from European countries
  with different healthcare systems. This result could be the foundation to
  create a service which help the citizens to handle their own healthcare data,
  in a context in which the citizens moves around Europe.
