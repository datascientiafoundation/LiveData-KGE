title: Trentino Healthcare Connectivity
organization: KnowDive
notes: >-
  The purpose of this project is to help patients and healthcare workers commute
  from and to different healthcare facilities in Trentino. We focus on public
  transport, such as busses and trains, as well as less conventional ways of
  travelling such as car sharing and taxis in order for our final users to save
  both time and money.
